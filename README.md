# Fair or Fair-Weather: A meet in the middle map app
Developed in React Native by Petra Laohakul

Use location services to find an ideal meeting point between you and your friend based on public transportation routes.

The app will draw the most efficient route paths between you and your friend. 
In cities like NYC, the routes are not always the same. Fair or Fair-Weather helps visualize subway paths and will estimate the fairest, best possible travel time between you and your friend.
Use the map to find points of interest at the desired meeting location and open up Google maps to navigate there!
